[x] Get VSCode to be able to do autocomplete
[ ] Return objects from all of my functions so that I can log
[ ] See if it's possible to add the container-bound script to my project
(it's not possible! I wonder if I should have it be a separate project, or 
if I should make it part of this library (maybe in a sub-directory; such
that you just have to define a couple of file-names in any given 
container-bound script))
[ ] Add logging functions to the container bound script
